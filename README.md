# Oz Newman; Shepherding streams of tokens

> "Streams of tokens" is a play on words of the phrase "streams of consciousness" to describe "The Process". The Process is what I call the series of events up to and specifically at the moment of a token being generated and experienced

---

> Coming soon: I deleted my body of work a while ago to "move on" beyond coding. Most of these projects are older and recovered from forks, but are being reimagined for modern AI. More details soon!
