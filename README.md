# Oz Newman, Stream Shepherd

This monorepo serves as a  human-AI collaborative devlog on explorations around the idea of "shepherding streams of tokens", a play on words on "shepherding a stream of consciousness"

## Research Questions
- [ ] Is it possible to have an LLM embody itself in a robot with no internet?
- [ ] How can humans become copilots to AI?
- [ ] Is it possible to disconnect from Internet completely, relying only on AI?

## Creative research restrictions
- No traditional internet use; only generative AI
- 100% prompted; no coding

# Roadmap
- [ ] Configure base system
- [ ] Setup local AI
- [ ] Expand to cloud AI
- [ ] Generative chroot filesystem
- [ ] Generative browser
- [ ] Clone this repo into a web based linux emulator
